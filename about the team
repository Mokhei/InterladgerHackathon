what comes next?
i wish we could have managed our time better and planned our project better. we relised too late that our project was too big for the required or specified time frame, we could have also split the work load better and worked and worked more effiecently. one of our teammates overworked himself and ended up experincing burn out, which in return slowed us down and hindered our progress and chances of completing the project
